## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes high-resolution images of plant root systems, specifically barley plants. This dataset provides ground truth annotations for root images (labelled by the [**RootTracer**](https://github.com/MaicholD95/RootTracer) tool), stored in RSML (Root System Markup Language) format, enabling efficient root phenotyping and segmentation for machine learning models.

### Key Features:
- **Plant Type:** Barley (*Hordeum vulgare*)
- **Original Resolution:** 6000x4000 pixels -> cropped and resized
- **Image Format:**  `.jpg`
- **Annotation Format:** RSML
- **Number of Images:** 122 high-resolution root images
- **Annotation Type:** Manual root tracing using RootTracer tool, saved in RSML format or Json format


## Data Structure

### Splits
- **train/**: Contains 90 images
- **test/**: Contains 10 images
- **test2/**: Contains 11 images (with more simple root strucure), the test images used in the paper [2]
- **test3/**: Contains 11 images,the test images used in the paper [3]
  
### Folder Structure:
- **images/**: Contains the raw high-resolution images of the plant root systems.
- **rsml/**: Contains the RSML files corresponding to each image, with the annotated root systems.
  
### File Types:
- **Images**: High-resolution  `.jpg` files of the plant root systems.
- **RSML Files**: XML-based files that represent the root system architectures.

## Annotations

The dataset includes manually annotated root systems, with key points marked along the root structure. The RSML format captures essential features like:
- Root origin
- Root tips
- Intermediate points
- Secondary roots

These annotations serve as the ground truth for training and validating machine learning models for root segmentation.

## Data Collection Process

The barley root images were collected under controlled conditions. The roots were grown in **CD cases** filled with absorbent paper, and images were taken using a **Nikon D5600** camera in a controlled growth chamber. The dataset includes images from different sessions, each exhibiting varying lighting and exposure conditions.

### Dataset Challenges:
- **Variable Backgrounds:** Due to different types of absorbent paper used, background textures vary from smooth to rough, with some showing yellow stains.
- **Lighting Conditions:** Uneven lighting and low contrast in certain sessions.
- **Overlapping Roots:** Each image may contain up to three seeds, and their roots often overlap, making annotation complex.

## Usage

The dataset is designed for use with the **RootTracer** tool for plant phenotyping and root system analysis. It is suitable for:
- Training deep learning models for automated root segmentation.
- Benchmarking automated root phenotyping tools.
- Analyzing root system structures in agricultural research.
